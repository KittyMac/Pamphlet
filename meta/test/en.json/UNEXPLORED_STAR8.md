Class B stars very "luminous", very energetic blue stars. Similar to class O stars, they tend to burn through their hydrogen very quicky and live for a relatively short period of time. Similar to class O stars, class B stars are unlikely to have many planets. Dwarf stars are older and cooler with decreased likelihood of habitable planets.
