Class O stars as very hot and extremely luminous, with most of their radiated output in the ultraviolet range. They are typically massive stars with very hot cores, burning through their hydrogen fuel very quickly. Class O stars are unlikely to have many planets at all, let alone habitable planets. Habitable planets in binary systems often take advantage of the increased radiation exposure to provide a more fertaile environment.
